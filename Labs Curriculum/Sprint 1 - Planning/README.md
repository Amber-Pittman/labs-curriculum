# Curriculum Authoring Basics

> The entire contents of this file *will* appear on GitHub, but only the main title (Sprint Name) and Overview section will be seen by students.

## Overview

Text here will be presented at the top of the page for this sprint on Training Kit. Use it to introduce the entire sprint, including an overview of _what_ students will learn, and _why_ they're learning it.

### Sprint Challenge

> Note: # should be replaced with the Sprint number

### Sprint Challenge Solution

## Structure

### Module Folders

In addition to a README file like this one, the top level folder in each sprint folder should include folders for each Module (ie. day) of curriculum. These folders should be named like so:

![Sprint Top Level Folder Structure](../images/SprintTopLevel.png)

The format here is important. Each folder should begin with `Module X` where X is the module number, followed by a space, then a hyphen, then a space, followed by the module's name.

### Objective Files

Inside each module folder, the only files should be individual markdown files for each objective in that module. These should be named like so:

![Module Folder Structure](../images/ModuleFolder.png)

Again, the format here is important. Each folder should begin with `Objective X` where X is the objective number, followed by a space, then a hyphen, then a space, followed by the objective's casual name.

See the markdown files inside the `Module 1 - Structure and Markdown Basics` folder for example format, as well as more information about the structure of this repo and the Markdown format:
