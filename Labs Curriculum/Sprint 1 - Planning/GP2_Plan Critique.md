## Purpose

Everything at Lambda is engineered to prepare you for your future job. Framing your learning in the context of its application on the job or in a hiring manager interview should serve as a vital reminder of your trajectory.

Recontextualizing your user story task breakdowns as an exercise in interview prep serves as an excellent example of how we want you to reimagine the real-world relevance of all the work you do here.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### Review takewaways from yesterday's guided project

* Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our guided project on user stories and planning.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing Trello boards

* Your instructor picks three teams and reviews their trello boards as a group exercise.

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your task breakdown process.

#### Speaking about your process

* Your instructor and a Career Specialist use a student Trello board to create several resume power statements and conduct a mock interview:
  * "How did you break down your tasks? What aspects of the project did you have clear ownership of?"
  * "How did you divide up work to deliver on time?"
  * "What were the results or outcomes of dividing the project the way the team did? Was this process effective?"
* Your instructor conducts this interview in front of the class and the Career Specialist reiterates what makes a power statement. Your instructor may also use some student-curated questions. You're encouraged to write your own questions based on your task breakdown.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.
