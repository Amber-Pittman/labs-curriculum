## Purpose

Creating architecture starts with a hierarchical deconstruction.

A top-level concept of the system's required functions is broken down into sub-functions; the most abstract version of its physical form is broken down into subsystems capable of performing the sub-functions, and so on for other types of breakdowns. A prerequisite for any product development planning.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### What is an architecture breakdown?

* Your instructor discusses the mechanics of an architecture breakdown, its utility, and what you'll be accomplishing.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing product requirements

* Your instructor takes a product roadmap and reviews the product requirements with you.

#### High-level architecture diagram

* Guiding class participation via Slack, your instructor creates a component diagram and data flow diagram, incorporating your suggestions.

#### Technical details

* Your instructor walks you through the frameworks and libraries to use.

#### Data model

* Your instructor creates a database schema for the product.

### *You Do*

#### Setting up...stuff?
