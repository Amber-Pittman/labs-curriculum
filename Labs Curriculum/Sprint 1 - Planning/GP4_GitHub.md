## Purpose

Useful as it is for the individual, a version control system becomes even more essential for software development on a team.

On a team, your level of professionalism as you go about the mechanics of a GitHub workflow (something you're all quite familiar with by now) can impact the efficiency of your teammates and the forward momentum of your product's development. It's not just you playing in your sandbox repo anymore -- it's important to do it right.

## Lesson

Why is version control important	I Do	Instructor describes the importance of version control in working with a team	5

Go though a GitHub flow	We Do	Instructor pulls up an example repository, creates a new branch, edits a file, pushes to the new branch. Instructor is actively asking students what each next step should be in the github flow process.	10

Writing a good pull request	We Do	After creating a file change, instructor writes a pull request in front of the students and describes why writing a good pull request is important	10

Students create a pull request	You Do	Instructor gives students a repo and students have to create a file change + write a good pull request in breakout rooms. 	20

Reviewing a pull request	We Do	Instructor brings everyone back to breakout rooms. Instructor pulls up 3 student examples of the pull request and reviews them live and gives feedback on GitHub.	10

Give students a PR to review	You Do	Instructor puts students in breakout rooms. Students are given a PR to review and they write a review together.	15

Review the Reviews	We Do	Instructor pulls up a couple of student examples of reviews and gives feedback on each review.	10

### *I Do*

#### Review takewaways from yesterday's guided project

* Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our guided project on user stories and planning.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing Trello boards

* Your instructor picks three teams and reviews their trello boards as a group exercise.

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your task breakdown process.

#### Speaking about your process

* Your instructor and a Career Specialist use a student Trello board to create several resume power statements and conduct a mock interview:
  * "How did you break down your tasks? What aspects of the project did you have clear ownership of?"
  * "How did you divide up work to deliver on time?"
  * "What were the results or outcomes of dividing the project the way the team did? Was this process effective?"
* Your instructor conducts this interview in front of the class and the Career Specialist reiterates what makes a power statement. Your instructor may also use some student-curated questions. You're encouraged to write your own questions based on your task breakdown.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.
