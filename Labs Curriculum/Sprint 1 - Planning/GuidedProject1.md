#### Preclass Announcement

*Send students a Slack message with links to any student-facing resources (Training Kit material, required downloads, etc.) as well as any other relevant reminders or information before Training Kit hour. Include the objectives to keep the group focused.*

*Add your preclass announcment below (ready to copy and paste into Slack):*

*This is great place to show personality and set the tone for the day.*

## During Class

### Schedule

Here's an overview of our guided project schedule today.

| Time Stamp | Activity                        |

| 01:00      | End                             |

### The Hook

Start with a question or activity that will help you gauge students' knowledge of the topic or any preconceived notions they might have. It can be as simple as taking a simple poll: "How many of you have heard of X?" It might also be a more thoughtfully designed poll or question that you post in Slack at the beginning of the day, where you use the student responses to help shape/inform your instruction time.

Besides the knowledge-check discussed above, also develop a creative introduction to the topic that stimulates interest and encourages deep-thinking. You could use a variety of approaches:

* personal anecdote
* historical event
* thought-provoking dilemma
* real-world example/case-study
* short video clip
* practical application demo
* probing question

Consider the following questions when planning your introduction:

* How will I check whether students know anything about the topic or have any preconceived notions about it?
* What are some commonly held ideas (or possibly misconceptions) about this topic that students might be familiar with or might espouse?
* What will I do to introduce the topic?

*Note: More science! Hooks set a tone for deep, engaged learning and lead to statistically significant better results. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cArUHPZjilc&list=PLUHJNxb4jAaZYqAMJ9P90u4JCSV3MsQkH&index=30).

### Purpose

Here is where you make it clear **why** the students need to learn the material you are covering, **what** they will be able to "do", and **how** they will show that they have learned the material.

You should communicate this to the students at the beginning of the lesson and reiterated throughout the lesson.

## Guided Project

### I Do

**Discuss what a user story is**

- Instructor describes what a user story is.
  
**Walk through an application**

- Instructor pulls up the AllTrails web application and asks for what user stories there are in slack.

### We Do

**Students go through an application**

- Give students a list of existing web applications. Have students list out as many user stories as possible in 5 minutes and what page that user story exists on. 

**Go over students' examples**

- Instructor goes through students' user stories and provides feedback.
  
**Breaking a product roadmap down into user stories**

- Instructor pulls up Citrics product roadmap and creates trello cards for each user story.

**Adding supplemental tasks to the user stories**

- Instructor puts a checklist of tasks to accomplish a single user story on the Citrics product. For instance, "As a judge, I can view all the projects I need to score." Instructor breaks that down into a checklist of technical tasks that need to be completed.

### You Do

**Students break down a single user story**

- In breakout rooms, give students the user story, "As a judge, I can individually score a project." Students need to create all the technical tasks associated with completing that task.
  
**Go over students' examples**

- Instructor pulls up examples of students task breakdown and provides feedback.

##### Check for Understanding

This section is where you summarize how you will know if students are learning. You need to think about specific questions you can ask students to check for understanding. Write them out and paraphrase them in multiple ways. This process prepares you to ask the questions in multiple ways to get the most responses from the students. You should also decide ahead of time which questions you want the students to respond to orally vs. in writing. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you go through this step:

* What questions will I ask students to check for understanding?
* What will I have students do to show that they are following?
* Going back to my list of learning objectives, what activities can I have students do to check they have accomplished each of those?
* What data signifies that I can move on in my lesson? (i.e. 70% correct)

The questions you create here should be pre-written and ready for the TLs to drop in Slack as a thread at the correct time during the lesson. The responses to the questions provide critical real-time data that will help inform your decision to slow down, reteach/rephrase the most recent information, or move on.

*Note: A valuable strategy that helps you with time management is to anticipate students‚Äô questions. When planning your lesson, decide what kinds of questions are productive for discussion and what questions might sidetrack the class. Think about and decide on the balance between covering content (accomplishing your learning objectives) and ensuring that students understand.*

##### Breakout

If you are pushing students to breakout rooms, include details about the `You Do` portion of the project here.

Again, this is a great place to draft a slack message with detailed instructions for students who need it.

### Conclusion & Preview

You should now go over all the material you are covering in this lesson and summarize the main points. During instruction, you can do this by just going through the main points yourself, you can ask a student to summarize them, or you can ask all the students to summarize them in writing. These written summaries can then show what most students "got" and what they might have missed. You can quickly emphasize anything they might have missed at the beginning of the next lesson.

Besides summarizing the lesson, the conclusion of your lesson should also be a preview of the lesson to come. It's a chance for you to ignite their interest in future material and also help them make connections between what they just learned and what they are learning soon.

## After Class

### Challenge and Resources

If there are any additional resources you'd like to share with your cohort, list them here. Where possible, link to these in the project repo or sandbox.

* üîê [Module Challenge](github.com/challenge)
* üìå [Helpful Resource](www.example.com)

### Exit Ticket

Exit Tickets act as a final CFU to discern what student's gathered from the lecture (before the challenge). The data gathered from the exit ticket can inform sections of the guided project the next day, where it would be helpful to emphasize content from previous modules. They can also inform the changes you might make before an instructor teaches the module again. You need to share the link below with the students in Slack at the end of the lesson.

Learn more about exit tickets from "Teach Like a Champion" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtaTMMo8J2o).

### Reminders

Similar to the pre-class announcements above, occasionally, it makes sense to include module-specific reminders for special days.

## Post Mortem

After class, take at least 5 minutes to reflect on the lesson you taught today. What would you change next time?

Change your lesson plan now, or jot down thoughts here, so you don't forget for the next cohort.
