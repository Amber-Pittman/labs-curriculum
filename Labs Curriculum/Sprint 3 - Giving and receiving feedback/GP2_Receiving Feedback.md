## Purpose

"Hey, don't get all defensive! I was just giving you some feedback." Guess what's a whole lot harder than giving feedback: receiving feedback. You worked hard, and watching someone critique your work product hurts. It feels personal -- but it doesn't have to.

You'll be receiving feedback for as long as you find yourself in a workplace (from colleagues, managers, clients, etc.), so learning how to receive it gracefully will serve you throughout your career.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### General feedback overview

* Your Career Specialist gives a short presentation on the fundamental "dos and don'ts" of receiving feedback.

### *We Do*

#### Feedback demonstration

* Your instructors conduct a mock feedback session, one giving feedback to the other. Unfortunately, the receiver doesn't take it so well...

#### Debrief

* Your Career Specialist guides a Slack discussion about what the instructor receiving feedback could have done better. Your Career Specialist identifies opportunities for improvement.

#### Feedback follow-up demonstration

* The class helps the instructor who received feedback compose a message to thank and acknowledge the instructor who provided the feedback with clear direction on how they intend to improve.

### *You Do*

#### Inquiry and follow-up

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and how students should follow up on both the positive and the growth feedback they received.
