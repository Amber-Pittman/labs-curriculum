## Purpose

Everything at Lambda is engineered to prepare you for your future job. Framing your learning in the context of its application on the job or in a hiring manager interview should serve as a vital reminder of your trajectory.

Recontextualizing your user architecture breakdown as an exercise in interview prep serves as an excellent example of how we want you to reimagine the real-world relevance of all the work you do here.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### Review takeaways from yesterday's guided project

* Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our previous guided project on engineering.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing Trello boards

* Your instructor picks three teams and conducts a review of their architecture documents for the class.

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your architecture breakdown.

#### Speaking about your process

* Your instructor and a Career Specialist select a student’s architecture document and pretend it’s theirs. The Career Specialist interviews your instructor:
  * “Describe a technical choice you made.”
  * “Given the decision you made, what do you feel are some of the risks?”
  * “What challenges do you foresee with the architecture your team selected?”
* Your instructor conducts this interview in front of the class, incorporating some student-curated questions as well. The Career Specialist offers tips and feedback on responding to these sorts of questions.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.
