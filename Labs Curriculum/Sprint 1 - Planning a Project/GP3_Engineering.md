## Purpose

Architecture is a prerequisite for any product development planning.

A top-level concept of the system's required functions is broken down into sub-functions; the most abstract version of its physical form is broken down into subsystems capable of performing the sub-functions, and so on for other types of breakdowns.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### What is an architecture breakdown?

* Your instructor discusses the mechanics of an architecture breakdown, its utility, and what you'll be accomplishing.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing product requirements

* Your instructor takes a product roadmap and reviews the product requirements with you.

#### High-level architecture diagram

* Guiding class participation via Slack, your instructor creates a component diagram and data flow diagram, incorporating your suggestions.

#### Technical details

* Your instructor walks you through the frameworks and libraries to use. Constraints, standards, site management, and scaffolding will also be discussed.

#### Data model

* Your instructor will identify models, discuss normalization, and create a database schema for the product.

### *You Do*

#### Working as a team

* Your instructor will direct you to spend time working on your architecture as a team.

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you've learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don't hesitate to reach out.
