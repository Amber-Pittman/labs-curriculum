## Purpose

Useful as it is for the individual, a version control system becomes even more essential for software development on a team.

On a team, your level of professionalism in a GitHub workflow (something you're all quite familiar with by now) can impact your teammates efficiency and the forward momentum of your product's development. It's not just you playing in your sandbox anymore -- sloppy process has consequences.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### Why version control is important

* Your instructor describes the importance of version control in working with a team.

### *We Do*

#### GitHub workflow walkthrough

* Using an example repository, your instructor creates a new branch, edits a file, and pushes to the new branch -- engaging with student participation throughout and soliciting suggestions for next steps.

#### Writing a good pull request

* After creating a file change, your instructor demonstrates writing a pull request and discusses the importance of writing a good pull request.

#### Creating a pull request

* Your instructor provides a repo, and in breakout rooms, gives you time to create a file change and practice writing a good pull request.

#### Reviewing a pull request

* After returning from your breakout rooms, your instructor pulls up three student examples of pull requests and reviews them live, giving feedback on GitHub.

### *You Do*

#### Breakout room PR review

* Your instructor gives you a pull request to review in breakout rooms. You discuss and write your review as a group.

#### Reviewing your reviews

* Your instructor uses a few student examples of PR reviews to give feedback on their strengths and weaknesses.
