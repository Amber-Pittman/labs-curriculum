## I Do

This section is student-facing. It should teach the topic by explaining it, showing examples, etc. It should include images, diagrams, code snippets, etc. as appropriate. The student is *not* expected to follow along with anything in this section. Rather, it is to be read, as well as forming something of an outline script for the pre-class video for this objective.

Total reading time: 5-7 minutes.

## We Do

This section is student-facing. It should describe a excercise that the student is expected to follow along with. Instructions should be sufficient that a student can read them and complete the excercise. The excercise in this section will be demonstrated by the instructor in the corresponding video, again with the expectation that students watching the video will follow along.

Total expected time: 5-10 minutes.

## You Do

This section is student-facing. It should present a challenge for the student to complete on their own. Step-by-step, detailed instructions should *not* be provided, as the goal is for the student to use the skills and concepts learned in the previous two sections and to solve them by completing a task on their own. The requirements for the challenge will be explained at the end of the corresponding video as well, again with the expectation that students watching the video will complete the challenge after finishing the video.

Total expected time to complete: 5-15 minutes.
