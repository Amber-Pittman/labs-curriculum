# Use basic Markdown syntax to write curriculum

## Instructor Notes

As you teach this objective, focus on the most-used Markdown syntax. Explain that Markdown is at its best when it remains easy to read in plain text, but that more advanced features are available.

## I Do

Markdown is a file format that includes a very simple syntax for formatting, including headers, bold, italics, inline links, formatted lists, etc. Markdown is entirely written in plain text, and can be written and edited using any standard text editor. Markdown's formatting syntax is meant to look reasonable even when presented in its unprocessed plain text form.

Markdown can be converted to formatted HTML (or other formats) using a _Markdown Converter_.

To create a heading, Start a line with hash symbols (#), as you see in this document. One hash makes an `<h1>` which is the largest heading text. Two makes an `<h2>` which is slightly smaller, and so on.

Make text **bold** by surrounding it with two asterisks. Make text _italic_ by surrounding it with underscores (_). You can mark text as code by surounding it with backticks (\`): `programCode();`. If you want to actually type a backtick, put a backslash in front of it: \`.

You can also do a whole section of code by surrounding it with lines consisting of triple backticks:

```language
This
is
a
code
block
```

Create a list by putting hyphens (-) or asterisks (*) at the beginning of successive lines:

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

Links can be created by putting the link name in square brackets ([]) followed immediately by the link URL in parenthesis, like [this](http://www.example.com/).

## We Do

Follow along to create a new markdown document:

1. Open your favorite text editor. TextEdit on Mac, NotePad on Windows, or vim on Linux will all work.
2. Create a plain text file.
3. Start a heading on the first line by typing a # followed by the text of the heading. For example: `# My First Markdown Document`
4. Write some text. Try **bolding** some words, and making others _italics_.
5. Create a list by putting hyphens at the beginning of each line.
6. When you're done, try pasting your document into [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) to see what it looks like when formatted.

## You Do

Practice by creating another Markdown document. Try various features including adding links, various heading sizes, lists, code blocks, etc.

Challenge yourself by figuring out how to embed an image in a Markdown document.
