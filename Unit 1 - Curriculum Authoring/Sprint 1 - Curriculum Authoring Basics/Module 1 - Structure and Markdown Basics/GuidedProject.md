> This page can include links to lesson plan materials, or (ideally) a lesson plan readme as outlined below 

# [Sprint Name] - [Module Name] Lesson Plan

You should store the Lesson Plan for each Guided Project as a README.md in that Guided Project's solution folder.

## [Training Kit](www.example.com)

## Objectives

You should list the objectives from Training Kit that correspond to this Guided Project's Sprint and Module. You should align the Training Kit objectives and Guided Project objectives. If you have objectives for this Guided Project that you haven't included in Training Kit, remedy this problem as soon as possible.

## Before Class

### Instructor Resources

Include instructor-facing resources here. Examples could include links to the Guided Project starter, Guided Project solution code, miscellaneous instructor-facing FAQ guides, etc.

* üêô [Guided Project Starter](www.example.com)
* üêô [Guided Project Solution](www.example.com)
* üêô [Training Kit GitHub Repo](www.example.com)

### Student-Facing Resources & Materials [Optional]

Under the following subheadings, list all the resources and materials that students and instructors will use. Include details about **how** they will use them.

*Note: For links that you will share with students via Slack, it is often helpful to include a block that you can easily copy-and-paste into Slack.

#### External Resources [Optional]

These are high-quality resources that can supplement student learning and TK material.

*Note: To maintain Training Kit as the single source of truth, add these resources to Training Kit, if you feel there are additional resources that your cohort needs that don't belong on Training Kit list them here.

* üìù [Helpful Article](www.medium.com)
* üé• [Helpful Video](www.youtube.com)

#### Preclass Announcement

Combine the resources above into a Slack message to present to students at the start of Training Kit Hour. Include links to the Training Kit material, required downloads, and other resources.

* üì• [Required Download](www.example.com)
* üíØ [Important Resource](www.example.com)

Since you will share these resources with students via Slack, it is often helpful to include a block that you can easily copy-and-paste into Slack. This section is a great place to include your personality as an instructor and set the tone for the day. Note that Slack doesn't support markdown link format, I'd suggest `* title - link`.

----

## During Class

### Start of Class Announcement

Aggregate the daily resources, entry ticket, the agenda, and objectives into one slack message to share before class begins. (Note: depending on your style, it may make sense to share at the start of Training Kit Hour, or the start of a lecture.)

* üß© [Guided Project Starter](www.example.com)
* ‚ùì [Slido](www.example.com)
* üé• [Zoom Link](www.example.com)
* ‚úÖ [Entry Ticket](www.example.com)

*Note: Posting objectives improves instructor and student focus. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjrU50EKtjc&list=PLUHJNxb4jAaZYqAMJ9P90u4JCSV3MsQkH&index=2&t=0s).

### Schedule

Use this space to generate a rough outline of your lecture time using the guided project demonstrations and objectives as a reference. Aim to include one demonstration per objective at a minimum.

While you might not stick rigidly to a schedule during class, the act of creating one can help ensure that you are sticking to your instructional goals, and give a suitable amount of time to more critical objectives.

| Time Stamp | Activity                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 9:00       | Morning Announcement            |
| 9:05       | Hook                            |
| 9:10       | Demo Concept 1 (I do and We do) |
| 9:20       | Breakout Room 1                 |
| 9:30       | Break                           |
| 9:35       | Demo Concept 2 (I do and We do) |
| 9:50       | Breakout Room 2                 |
| 10:00      | Slido Questions                 |
| etc.       | etc.                            |

### The Hook

Often, it's a good idea to start with a question or activity that will help you gauge students' knowledge of the topic or any preconceived notions they might have. It can be as simple as taking a simple poll: "How many of you have heard of X?" It might also be a more thoughtfully designed poll or question that you post in Slack at the beginning of the day, where you use the student responses to help shape/inform your instruction time.

Besides the knowledge-check discussed above, also develop a creative introduction to the topic that stimulates interest and encourages deep-thinking. You could use a variety of approaches:

* personal anecdote
* historical event
* thought-provoking dilemma
* real-world example/case-study
* short video clip
* practical application demo
* probing question

Consider the following questions when planning your introduction:

* How will I check whether students know anything about the topic or have any preconceived notions about it?
* What are some commonly held ideas (or possibly misconceptions) about this topic that students might be familiar with or might espouse?
* What will I do to introduce the topic?

*Note: More science! Hooks set a tone for deep, engaged learning and lead to statistically significant better results. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cArUHPZjilc&list=PLUHJNxb4jAaZYqAMJ9P90u4JCSV3MsQkH&index=30).

### Purpose

Here is where you make it clear **why** the students need to learn the material you are covering, **what** they will be able to "do", and **how** they will show that they have learned the material.

You should communicate this to the students at the beginning of the lesson and reiterated throughout the lesson.

### Learning Activities

Here is where you plan the main body of the lesson. As you plan each example and activity/demonstration, estimate how much time you spend on each. Leave time for an extended explanation or discussion. Use the questions below to help design learning activities:

* What will I do to explain the topic?
* What will I do to illustrate the topic differently?
* How can I engage students in the topic?
* What are some relevant real-life examples, analogies, or situations that can help students understand the topic?
* What will students need to do to help them understand the topic better?
* How am I incorporating IWY (I do/ We do/ You do) loops into the project?
* What are the time commitments I want to hold myself to? (i.e., I will complete learning activity #1 by 9:30 am)

#### Demonstration 1

Nothing goes here. The `#####` headers that follow are sections that you should consider when planning a demonstration. You should expect to duplicate this section for as many demonstrations as exist.

##### Key Points

* This is an important thing to say
* This is another essential thing to say
* This is a third important thing, sometimes addressing a common misconception

##### Guided Project

This section is for the portion of the solution code that you will reveal in this demonstration.

```
Here is some code that I will add to the guided project
```

##### Check for Understanding

This section is where you summarize how you will know if students are learning. You need to think about specific questions you can ask students to check for understanding. Write them out and paraphrase them in multiple ways. This process prepares you to ask the questions in multiple ways to get the most responses from the students. You should also decide ahead of time which questions you want the students to respond to orally vs. in writing. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you go through this step:

* What questions will I ask students to check for understanding?
* What will I have students do to show that they are following?
* Going back to my list of learning objectives, what activities can I have students do to check they have accomplished each of those?
* What data signifies that I can move on in my lesson? (i.e. 70% correct)

The questions you create here should be pre-written and ready for the TLs to drop in Slack as a thread at the correct time during the lesson. The responses to the questions provide critical real-time data that will help inform your decision to slow down, reteach/rephrase the most recent information, or move on.

*Note: A valuable strategy that helps you with time management is to anticipate students‚Äô questions. When planning your lesson, decide what kinds of questions are productive for discussion and what questions might sidetrack the class. Think about and decide on the balance between covering content (accomplishing your learning objectives) and ensuring that students understand.*

##### Resources and Notes

Use this space to keep track of any resources - internal or external - that you want to share at this point in the lesson.

* üìù [Documentation](https://jestjs.io/)
* ‚å® [Exercise Breakout Link](https://codesandbox.io/s/objective-shamir-7qstq)
* üìè [Converter Formulas](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_length_converter.asp)

##### Breakout

If you are pushing students to breakout rooms, include details about the `You Do` portion of the project here.

Again, this is a great place to draft a slack message with detailed instructions for students who need it.

### Conclusion & Preview

You should now go over all the material you are covering in this lesson and summarize the main points. During instruction, you can do this by just going through the main points yourself, you can ask a student to summarize them, or you can ask all the students to summarize them in writing. These written summaries can then show what most students "got" and what they might have missed. You can quickly emphasize anything they might have missed at the beginning of the next lesson.

*Note: This is where you would drop your End of Class Announcement in Slack.*

Besides summarizing the lesson, the conclusion of your lesson should also be a preview of the lesson to come. It's a chance for you to ignite their interest in future material and also help them make connections between what they just learned and what they are learning soon.

## After Class

### End of Class Announcement

#### Challenge and Resources

If there are any additional resources you'd like to share with your cohort, list them here. Where possible, link to these in the project repo or sandbox.

* üîê [Module Challenge](github.com/challenge)
* üìå [Helpful Resource](www.example.com)

#### Exit Ticket

Exit Tickets act as a final CFU to discern what student's gathered from the lecture (before the challenge). The data gathered from the exit ticket can inform sections of the guided project the next day, where it would be helpful to emphasize content from previous modules. They can also inform the changes you might make before an instructor teaches the module again. You need to share the link below with the students in Slack at the end of the lesson.

Learn more about exit tickets from "Teach Like a Champion" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtaTMMo8J2o).

* üõë [Example Exit Ticket](https://forms.gle/641FadYDvwCDay9U9)

#### Reminders

Similar to the pre-class announcements above, occasionally, it makes sense to include module-specific reminders for special days.

#### Slack Message [Optional]

In this section, aggregate resources and reminders into one slack message to share when you finish the Guided Project lesson.

## Post Mortem

After class, take at least 5 minutes to reflect on the lesson you taught today. What would you change next time?

Change your lesson plan now, or jot down thoughts here, so you don't forget for the next cohort.
