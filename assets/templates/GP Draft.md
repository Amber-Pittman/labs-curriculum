# Student can articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks.

## Instructor Notes

This should take about an hour.

Source as many student examples as posible, wherever possible. Use slack to your advantage: guide the lesson with it.

## Required Resources

- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HgKFg8vbAsrptP_cIN-b6_QkZ2mbsy1m4AMrn7BRqd0/edit#slide=id.g89f88c27ec_0_31)

## I Do

Go over what a user story is.
- Instructor describes what a user story is.
  
Go through an application
- Instructor pulls up the AllTrails web application and asks for what user stories there are in slack.

## We Do

Students go through an application
- Give students a list of existing web applications. Have students list out as many user stories as possible in 5 minutes and what page that user story exists on. 

Go over students' examples
- Instructor goes through students' user stories and provides feedback.
  
Breaking a product roadmap down into user stories
- Instructor pulls up Hackathon Portal product roadmap and creates trello cards for each user story.

Adding supplemental tasks to the user stories
- Instructor puts a checklist of tasks to accomplish a single user story on the Hackathon Portal product. For instance, "As a judge, I can view all the projects I need to score." Instructor breaks that down into a checklist of technical tasks that need to be completed.

## You Do

Students break down a single user story
- In breakout rooms, give students the user story, "As a judge, I can individually score a project." Students need to create all the technical tasks associated with completing that task.
  
Go over students' examples
- Instructor pulls up examples of students task breakdown and provides feedback.
